# ELKOSTART - ABOUT US PAGE CONTENT

---

## HERO SECTION

### Main Headline:
**We're Not Just Web Designers.**  
**We're Lead Generation Partners.**

### Subheadline:
Every business deserves a website that doesn't just look good—it converts visitors into qualified leads and paying clients. That's exactly what we build.

---

## SECTION 1: FROM CHALLENGE TO SOLUTION

### Heading:
**From Outdated Websites to Lead Machines**

### Body Copy:

Most business owners we meet have the same problem: they have great services, strong reputations, but websites that don't capture leads or convert visitors into clients.

In 2024, we built our first automated lead-generation website for a real estate agency. The result? A 40% increase in qualified inquiries within 6 weeks. We realized that businesses don't need "just another website"—they need complete lead generation systems.

Since then, we've expanded to work with construction companies, roofing contractors, service providers, and local businesses across the US, Canada, and UK. We don't just build pages—we build systems that turn your online presence into your most powerful sales tool.

Today, we're a specialized team that creates advanced, high-converting websites with built-in automation, CRM integration, and follow-up systems that work while you sleep.

## SECTION 3: HOW WE WORK

### Heading:
**How We Work**

### Subheading:
Simple. Fast. Focused. No endless back-and-forth. Just results.

---

### Step 01: Strategy Before Screens
**We analyze your business goals first.**

Before we design a single page, we understand your target audience, your competitors, and what makes you different. We map out the entire lead generation flow so every element has a purpose.

---

### Step 02: Collaboration, Not Handoffs
**You're involved every step of the way.**

We don't disappear for weeks. You'll see progress updates, review designs, and give feedback throughout the process. This is your business—we build it with you, not for you.

---

### Step 03: Quality Over Speed
**We build it right the first time.**

We don't cut corners. Every website is mobile-optimized, fast-loading, SEO-ready, and tested across devices. You get a system that works perfectly from day one.

---

### Step 04: Results-Obsessed Launch
**We measure success by your growth.**

After launch, we track performance: lead capture rates, form submissions, traffic sources, and conversions. We optimize based on data, not guesses.

---

## SECTION 4: WHAT WE STAND FOR

### Heading:
**What We Stand For**

---

### Value 1: Radical Honesty
**Icon: 💬**

We tell you what you need to hear—not what you want to hear. If something won't work, we'll say it. We're consultants first, designers second.

---

### Value 2: Thoughtful Craft
**Icon: 🎨**

Every design choice serves a purpose. Every color, button, and headline is intentional. We don't follow trends—we build what converts.

---

### Value 3: Client Partnership
**Icon: 🤝**

You're not a project number. You're a partner. We're invested in your success because when you grow, we grow. Simple as that.

---

### Value 4: Continuous Improvement
**Icon: 📈**

Launch day isn't the finish line—it's the starting line. We monitor, test, and optimize so your website gets better with time, not outdated.

---

## SECTION 5: WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT

---

### Differentiator 5:
**Direct Communication** — No project managers playing telephone. You work directly with the people building your site.

---

### Differentiator 6:
**Post-Launch Support** — We don't vanish after launch. We monitor performance, provide updates, and make improvements based on real data.

---
