🟡 REMAINING PROBLEMS (What's Holding You Back from 9.5/10)
Problem 1: Portfolio Images Are Still Generic/Weak
Looking at the two visible projects:
Left Image: Road/pathway photo

Doesn't look like a website screenshot
Looks like a stock photo
Text overlay: "LEARN MORE"
Caption mentions something about sustainability

Right Image: Dark interface/dashboard

Better - looks like an actual website/app
Has "LEARN MORE" overlay
But it's dark and hard to see details

The Issue:
These don't look like your actual web design work. They look like:

Stock photos (left)
Generic templates (right)

What Premium Agencies Show:

Full browser mockups of actual websites they built
Clear, colorful, detailed screenshots
Before/after comparisons
Multiple device views (desktop + mobile)

How to Fix:
If these ARE your projects:

Show the full website, not just abstract images
Use browser mockup frames (Chrome browser with URL bar)
Show the homepage or key page clearly
Make sure the design quality is visible

If these are placeholder images:

Replace with actual website screenshots ASAP
Even personal projects - show the full site


Problem 2: Project Descriptions Are Too Vague
Left Project:

Category tag unclear (can't read it)
"LEARN MORE" tells me nothing
No visible results or metrics

Right Project:

Same issue - "LEARN MORE" overlay
Dark image makes it hard to see
No context about what it is

What's Missing:

Client name or project name (large, readable)
What type of project (E-commerce? Landing page? SaaS?)
One key result ("+180% sales" or "50% faster loading")
Tech stack or key features

Better Approach:
[Clear Screenshot]

PROJECT TYPE TAG
Urban Marketplace

"Modern e-commerce platform with custom checkout"
E-COMMERCE • 2024 • +180% SALES

Problem 3: "LEARN MORE" Overlay is Weak
Current: Just says "LEARN MORE" when hovering
Problems:

Too generic
Doesn't tell me what I'll learn
Feels like a placeholder
Doesn't create urgency

Better Options:

"View Case Study →"
"See Full Project →"
"Explore This Website →"
"View Live Site →"

Or remove the overlay entirely and let the image + description do the work.
